Description of App

My Project 1 is a database on facial hair styling! How many times have you encountered someone with a beard or a mustache, but you have no idea what it is a called? No more will you have to sheepishly say "Oh uh, nice beard...ha...ha...ha". Now you can say with confidence, "Nice [insert proper name of facial hair here]!" I know, what would you do without it?

User Story

User can add a facial hair entry at the bottom, filling out the forms for Name, Growth Time, and Description. Once submitted, their entry will display on the page (on page refresh). You can edit any existing hairstyle and you can delete any hairstyle.

Once a hairstyle is created, you can add a quote to it. This quote signifies what you should say to someone when you've encountered their majestic creation that proudly decorates their face.  Created quotes will display themselves on the page (on page refresh) and can be deleted. 

In a future editions, you will be able to pictures to existing hairstyles, if you feel that the current pictures do not accurately represent the hair entry style.
